# HR Analytics Project

## 📁 Project Files

* `HR_Analytics.csv` – The core dataset containing HR-related employee information.
* `HR_Analytics(project).ipynb` – Python Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
* `HR Analytics Dashboard.pbix` – Interactive Power BI dashboard offering visual insights from the data.

---

## 📌 Objective

The primary goal of this HR Analytics project is to explore, analyze, and visualize employee data to uncover trends and key factors affecting attrition, satisfaction, job involvement, and performance. This analysis supports data-driven decisions in HR policy and management.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains key HR attributes such as:

* Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status
* Job Role, Department, Years at Company
* Performance Rating, Job Involvement, Environment Satisfaction
* Monthly Income, Work-Life Balance, Overtime
* Attrition (target variable)

---

## 🔍 Jupyter Notebook Highlights

The notebook includes:

* **Data Import & Cleaning** – Handling null values, data types, and categorical encoding.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, attrition breakdowns.
* **Visualizations** – Charts to analyze relationships between features and attrition.
* **Insights** – Observations around job roles, departments, overtime, income, and satisfaction metrics.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI `.pbix` file contains:

* **Interactive Filters:** Gender, Department, Job Role, Marital Status.
* **Visuals Include:**

  * Attrition by Age, Gender, and Department
  * Income Distribution
  * Job Satisfaction vs. Attrition
  * Years at Company vs. Attrition
* **KPIs and Cards:** Overall attrition rate, average monthly income, etc.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Higher attrition is observed in employees working overtime and with lower satisfaction scores.
* Employees with shorter tenure or low job involvement tend to leave more often.
* Sales department has a relatively higher attrition rate.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Python** – Data analysis and visualization (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
* **Jupyter Notebook** – For code development and presentation.
* **Power BI** – For dynamic dashboard creation and storytelling.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Incorporate machine learning models for attrition prediction.
* Add time-series analysis for attrition trends.
* Integrate external datasets like engagement surveys or performance metrics.
